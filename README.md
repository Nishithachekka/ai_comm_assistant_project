# AI-Powered Communication Assistant (Sample Project)

This project processes a sample support emails dataset and produces:
- `processed_emails.csv` -- filtered support emails with extracted metadata, sentiment, priority and a draft response.
- `auto_responses.csv` -- compact list of generated draft responses.
- `dashboard.html` -- a simple static dashboard you can open in a browser to view filtered emails, stats, and editable draft replies.
- `app_guidelines.md` -- notes on how to extend this to a full app (IMAP/Gmail integration, LLM-based responses, RAG with knowledge base, dashboard frameworks).

Files were generated from the dataset: `68b1acd44f393_Sample_Support_Emails_Dataset.csv` on 2025-09-05T14:17:38.038610 UTC.

## How to use
1. Download the files and push to your GitHub repository.
2. Open `dashboard.html` in a browser to view results (static view).
3. For production, integrate with an email client (IMAP/Gmail API) and an LLM for real draft generation, and deploy a web app (Flask/Streamlit/React).

## Future Enhancements
Multi-language support
Integration with CRM tools (Salesforce, HubSpot)
Auto ticket creation for unresolved cases
Smart escalation workflows
