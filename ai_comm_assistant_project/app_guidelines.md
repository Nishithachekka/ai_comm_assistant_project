## 1. System Workflow
1. **Email Retrieval**
   - Connects to Gmail/Outlook/IMAP using APIs.
   - Fetches all incoming emails and filters those with relevant subject keywords: *Support, Query, Request, Help*.

2. **Categorization & Prioritization**
   - Sentiment analysis: Positive / Negative / Neutral.
   - Urgency detection: Urgent / Not Urgent (keywords like *immediately, critical, cannot access*).
   - Emails are ranked using a **priority queue** so urgent emails surface first.

3. **Information Extraction**
   - Extracts key details from the email body:
     - Customer contact details (phone, email, etc.)
     - Request/issue summary
     - Sentiment words
   - Displays these alongside the raw email on the dashboard.

4. **Response Generation**
   - AI model generates **context-aware, professional, empathetic** draft replies.
   - Uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with a knowledge base for accurate answers.
   - Replies can be reviewed/edited before sending.

5. **Dashboard & Analytics**
   - Shows filtered support emails in a structured format.
   - Key statistics:
     - Total emails (last 24 hours)
     - Resolved vs Pending
     - Sentiment and priority distribution
   - Interactive graphs for visualization.
